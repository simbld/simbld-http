// This file defines the `ResponsesInformationalCodes` enum and provides five main functionalities:
// 1. `to_u16()` - returns the standard HTTP code as a `u16`.
// 2. `from_u16(u16) -> Option<Self>` - attempts to build a variant from a given code.
// 3. `as_tuple()` - returns a `UnifiedTuple` with standard/internal codes, names, and a description.
// 4. `as_json()` - converts the variant to a JSON object.
// 5. `Into<(u16, &'static str)>` - yields `(std_code, std_name)`.
